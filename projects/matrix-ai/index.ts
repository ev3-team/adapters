  description:
    "The Matrix 1.0 blockchain platform is the first AI-optimised blockchain platform. Low transaction speeds, lack of security, the complexity of usage, and squandered resources are four key concerns in blockchain that we address with AI technology. We built a public blockchain platform that is both functional and reliable. The Matrix 2.0 constructs a blockchain-based AI economy based on data, computer power, and AI models. We're building a self-evolving AI platform with aggregated processing power, safe data management, transparent data sharing, and access to an ever-growing set of on-chain AI data, models, and applications. We are now at Matrix 3.0, which we blend neuroscience with AI and Blockchain. This is very rare in the blockchain space, and the closet one is NeuraLink driven by Elon Musk. We use EEG or brain signal for Avatar Intelligence (AvI). AvI aims to realize the scenario imagined by the Matrix films where human brain is uploaded to the Internet, or where a program identical to a user's brain is created on the Internet. This means everyone will have his/her own digital avatar in the Metaverse. This avatar can be used to live life and do various tasks in the Metaverse under users' authorisation. It covers 4 phases, and we are on the journey of the 1st phase.",
