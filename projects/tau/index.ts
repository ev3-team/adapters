  description:
    'Tau is an AI software generation tool that generates accurate software, with AI safety features. Tau enables users to create complex complete programs with a robust user interface for enterprise and allows developing software through multi-user collaborative agreements. At its core, Tau uses logic-based AI, created by combining logic or formal specification and knowledge representation. This unique approach allows Tau to create software that is provably correct, safe, and secure. Agoras is the cryptocurrency of Tau’s decentralized blockchain social network. Tau is the first-ever platform that will be able to take the thoughts, advice, and knowledge of its users and update its own software in real-time by having its users write in languages that both machines and people can read and understand. This allows Tau’s logic-based AI engine to understand what people say on the platform, connect all users’ ideas and thoughts and perform the updates users really want, giving all users control over what the software does and how it evolves at any scale.',
