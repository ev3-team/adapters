  description:
    'Toucan Protocol provides a blockchain-based platform for tokenised trading of carbon credits from the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). Carbon credits can be transferred into the Toucan platform from external non-blockchain carbon registries and stored as TCO2 crypto tokens. These TCO2 tokens can be purchased and “retired” by emitters to offset their environmental impact. The process of retiring TCO2 tokens takes them completely out of circulation on the blockchain.',
