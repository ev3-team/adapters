## Preparing a Pull Request

Try not to include more than one project/issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review
multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/adapters.git
cd adapters
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ev3-team/adapters.git
```

3. Synchronize your local `staging` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout staging
git pull upstream staging
```

4. Install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```sh
pnpm i
```

5. Create a new branch related to your PR:

```sh
git checkout -b project/<project-name>
```

6. Copy & rename an existing project folder, then fill out the relevant datapoints.

7. Generate new uniqueID and paste in into the new project file:

```sh
pnpm generate:project-id
```

7. Then commit and push to your forked repository:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

8. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/ev3-team/adapters) and
   [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

9. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an
   explanation. Please email ninja@ev3.xyz with any questions.

## Publishing a new version

In order to see the changes reflected in the frontend you'll have to publish a new package version, we are using changeset and github actions to do this, you can follow the next steps if you want to publish a new version:

- Make sure youâ€™re in staging branch with latest changes: `git checkout staging && git pull`
- Run `pnpm changeset` and fill in the two fields: 1. What kind of change is this.. and 2. Summary confirm changeset. (this step will generate a .md file in the .changeset folder )
- Then run `pnpm changeset version` this command will use the generated .md file to update the package.json with the new version and the update the CHANGELOG.md file with the new version description.
- Then commit and push this changes to staging.
- After you have all your changes ready to publish then merge staging into main, this step will trigger the publish ci job.
